# Product_Campaign_Analysis
Performed EDA on the campaign performance based on the redemption rates, and total sales by the products, and proposed recommendations t0 increase profit margins by 0.3%.

Problem Statement:- 

1. Was holiday a driver of sales or was it the promotion that helped in acquiring new customers, retaining existing customers, and overall increasing customer engagement?
2. What was the Expenditure Per Hour (EPH) when the promotion was active VS. when the promotion was not active?
3. What are the common demographics of the customers who displayed disparate purchasing patterns when the promotion was active VS. when the promotion was inactive?

Recommendations :-

1. To maximize customer response:
  Collect data from existing members for a certain time period, determine customer-to-promotion category match for individual customers, and send single    offers accordingly.
2. To predict new customer behavior
Additional data (e.g., occupation, education level, location) might be requested in the profile section, when a new customer signs up to be a Regork
to test for possible features that might contribute to a customer-to-promotion match.
3. To maximize success rate of Campaign A:
- Send single offers via social networks and mobile app.
- Offer discount and BOGO promotions with low purchase requirement
